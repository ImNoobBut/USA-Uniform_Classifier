# Uniform Detection with ResNet-50

![Uniform Detection](home.png)

Welcome to the Uniform Detection with ResNet-50 project! This project focuses on using deep learning and computer vision techniques to solve the problem of uniform detection. Whether you need to distinguish individuals wearing uniforms from those who are not, this repository provides a robust solution.

## Project Overview

This project consists of several key components:

- **Data Augmentation**: The dataset is enriched through data augmentation techniques, enhancing the model's ability to generalize from limited data.

- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is loaded, preprocessed, and split into training and validation sets. Images are resized to a specified input size for uniformity.

- **ResNet-50 Model**: A pre-trained ResNet-50 model is used as the foundation for the deep learning model, known for its feature extraction capabilities.

- **Custom Classification Head**: A custom classification head is added to make the model suitable for uniform detection. It includes global average pooling and fully connected layers with ReLU activation.

- **Transfer Learning**: The pre-trained layers of ResNet-50 are frozen to leverage knowledge gained from a large dataset. Only the custom classification layers are trained from scratch.

- **Model Training**: The model is trained using the prepared dataset, with essential callbacks for efficient training and model checkpointing.

- **Model Evaluation**: Model performance is evaluated on the validation set, monitoring metrics such as accuracy and loss.

- **Model Saving**: The final trained model is saved for future use, and the best-performing model during training is also preserved.

## Usage

This project provides a powerful tool for detecting uniforms in images. You can use the trained model to make predictions on new data or fine-tune it for your specific use case.
